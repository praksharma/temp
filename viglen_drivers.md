It is hard to find drivers for Viglen PC in 2022. The website is dead.

This ftp server is also dead: ftp://ftp.viglen.co.uk

But we can use wawback machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20091003130740/http://ftp.viglen.co.uk/

It turns out, this is the link to their drivers (which is also dead): https://web.archive.org/web/20091003131520/http://download.viglen.co.uk/files

We can't download the drivers but we can always find the name of the driver and find it somewhere else.
